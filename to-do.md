- [ ] Day.js for date handling
- [ ] Expo Notifications
- [x] AsyncStorage for persistence
- [ ] React Hook Form for forms

## üìù Development Notes

### Database Considerations
- All timestamps use `timestamptz`
- Match events use monotonic sequence per match
- RLS policies enforce security
- Fuzzy search uses pg_trgm indexes
- Realtime enabled for matches and match_events
- Seeded initial teams and players via migration `001_seed_initial_data.sql`

### State Management Strategy
- Global state: Redux (auth, user preferences)
- Server state: RTK Query (matches, teams, players)
- Local state: useState/useReducer (forms, UI)
- Realtime state: Subscription hooks

### Caching Strategy
- RTK Query: 5 min cache for lists, 1 min for details
- Images: Expo Image with disk caching
- Offline: Persist last 50 matches + followed teams
- Realtime: In-memory buffer with 500ms batching

### Error Handling
- Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff
- Auth errors: Redirect to login
- Validation errors: Form-level display
- Realtime errors: Fallback to polling
- General errors: Error boundary with retry
