- [ ] Day.js for date handling
- [ ] Expo Notifications
- [x] AsyncStorage for persistence
- [ ] React Hook Form for forms
- [ ] Zod for validation

## üìù Development Notes

### Database Considerations
- All timestamps use `timestamptz`
- Match events use monotonic sequence per match
- RLS policies enforce security
- Fuzzy search uses pg_trgm indexes
- Realtime enabled for matches and match_events
- Seeded initial teams and players via migration `001_seed_initial_data.sql`

### State Management Strategy
- Global state: Redux (auth, user preferences)
- Server state: RTK Query (matches, teams, players)
- Local state: useState/useReducer (forms, UI)
- Realtime state: Subscription hooks

### Caching Strategy
- RTK Query: 5 min cache for lists, 1 min for details
- Images: Expo Image with disk caching
- Offline: Persist last 50 matches + followed teams
- Realtime: In-memory buffer with 500ms batching

### Error Handling
- Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff
- Auth errors: Redirect to login
- Validation errors: Form-level display
- Realtime errors: Fallback to polling
- General errors: Error boundary with retry

**Current Status:** Phase 4 Core UI Screens Completed ‚úÖ + Admin Features Enhanced - Successfully implemented all main tab screens including tournaments:

### ‚úÖ Completed UI Screens
- **Matches Screen**: Tab layout (Upcoming/Live/Completed) with MatchCard component, pull-to-refresh, live badges, and status indicators
- **Teams Screen**: Team list with search functionality, team cards showing logos and player count, follow buttons (fixed Supabase ambiguous relationship error)
- **Players Screen**: Player cards with search and handicap filter, handicap badges, team affiliations
- **Tournaments Screen**: Tournament list with search, cards showing dates/location/status, detail view with standings showing W-L records, matches overview, and tournament statistics

### ‚úÖ Key UI Components Created
- `MatchCard` component with team names, scores, status indicators, and live badges
- Match detail screen with lineup display showing player goals
- Team card components with logos and metadata
- Player cards with position badges and handicap indicators  
- Search bars with clear functionality
- Pull-to-refresh on all screens
- Empty states with refresh buttons
- Comprehensive navigation between screens

### ‚úÖ Additional Bug Fixes Completed
- **Circular Dependencies**: Fixed circular imports between API index and API slices by moving imports to store configuration
- **AsyncStorage Error**: Resolved "window is not defined" error by creating cross-platform storage adapter for web/mobile compatibility  
- **Style Warnings**: Updated deprecated shadow* style properties to modern boxShadow syntax for React Native Web compatibility
- **Players Filter Fix**: Updated handicap filter to include 0 handicap players in the "‚â§ 0" filter option (previously only showed < 0)
- **Position Filter Removed**: Removed position filter from players screen per user request, keeping only handicap filter
- **Teams Query Fix**: Fixed teams not loading by specifying exact foreign key relationship `players!players_team_id_fkey` to resolve Supabase ambiguous relationship error
- **Admin Tab Routing**: Admin tab now opens the Admin Dashboard within tabs so the bottom nav remains visible
- **API Data Loading Fix**: Identified and documented critical security issue - app was using service_role key instead of anon key for Supabase, causing API failures. Added debug logging to baseQuery to help identify API issues. Created FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed steps to resolve the issue.
- **Admin Back Navigation Fix**: Fixed back navigation from admin subscreens (matches, tournaments, fields, players) to correctly return to admin dashboard at `/(app)/(tabs)/admin` instead of incorrect `/(app)/(admin)/` path
- **Admin Tabs Visibility Fix**: Hidden admin subscreens (matches, tournaments, fields, players) from bottom navigation bar - only main Admin tab is visible using `tabBarButton: () => null`
- **Profile Screen Removal**: Completely removed profile screen and all related files (index, edit, settings, notifications, followed-teams) per user request to simplify the app
- **Admin Item Management**: Added delete buttons with confirmation dialogs to admin management screens for tournaments, fields (locations), and players. Each item now has edit and delete icons with proper warning modals before deletion.
- **Aria-Hidden Focus Warning Fix**: Fixed "Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus" warning on web by creating SafeModal wrapper component that blurs active elements before modal opens. Replaced all Modal imports with SafeModal in matches/create.tsx, matches/[id].tsx, and all admin screens.
- **Match Edit Routing Fix**: Fixed edit match button routing from admin matches screen. The button was trying to route to non-existent `/edit` path. Now correctly routes to `/create?id={matchId}` which opens the create screen in edit mode.
- **Match Edit Functionality**: Added full match editing capabilities including:
  - Loading existing match data when in edit mode (teams, field, tournament, scheduled time, lineups)
  - Ability to update all match details and reassign players to teams
  - Delete existing lineups and create new ones when updating a match
  - UI updates to show "Edit Match" title and "Update Match" button when in edit mode
- **Match Edit Autofill Fix**: Fixed issue where existing match data wasn't being properly loaded in edit mode:
  - Resolved race condition where player selections were being cleared by team change useEffects
  - Added isInitialLoad flag to prevent resetting players during data load
  - Added setTimeout to ensure lineups are loaded after team IDs are set
  - Added loading state indicator while fetching existing match data
  - Now all match details (teams, field, tournament, time, player lineups) are correctly pre-populated when editing
- **Player Statistics Fix**: Fixed player detail pages not showing correct statistics:
  - Created SQL functions `get_player_stats` and `get_player_recent_matches` to calculate player data
  - Updated player detail screen to display recent matches with scores and results
  - Added visual indicators for wins/losses and goals scored in each match
  - Created PLAYER_STATS_FIX.md with instructions for applying database functions via Supabase dashboard
- **Tournaments Feature**: Added complete tournaments functionality:
  - Created tournaments list screen with search and status badges (Upcoming/Live/Completed)
  - Built tournament detail screen with team standings showing W-L records, points, and goal difference
  - Integrated tournament statistics (teams, matches, goals, average goals per match)
  - Added tournaments tab to bottom navigation between Home and Teams tabs
  - Utilized existing tournament API endpoints including `get_tournament_standings` RPC function

- **Tabbar Order/Label Fix**: Ensured Tournaments tab appears between Home and Teams and corrected Admin tab label (no longer shows `admin/index`).

Ready for additional admin features and tournament management.

### üì¶ New Migration Added
